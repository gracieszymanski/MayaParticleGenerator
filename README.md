# Maya Particle Generator and GUI

# Project Objectives:

#  ★ Create a GUI for Maya Particle Generator Code. This code creates a MEL or Python Script based on user input. This code 
# imported into Maya then creates the particle cloud shape.
#   ○ User input from GUI should include path output, chosen shape, and needed shape parameters

# My GUI:

#  ★ Includes widgets for user to enter:
#   ○ Script Name
#   ○ Output Location
#   ○ Mel or Python Language
#   ○ Particle Amount
#   ○ Cloud Center
#   ○ Shape
#   ○ Shape Parameters

# Added Features:

#  ★ Brief description at the top of how to use the app.
#  ★ Shape parameters for each specific shape do not appear until the user 
# selects the shape. This decreases the clutter of the app.
#  ★ The “GO!” button is not enabled until the user selects a folder output and a 
# shape as those are the minimum selections to run the app
